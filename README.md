A space-themed game involving aliens and a new planet sounds exciting! Here’s a game concept that could be a great first project in Pygame:
Galactic Explorer: Alien Planet Survival

    Concept: The player is an astronaut who has crash-landed on a mysterious alien planet. The objective is to survive by gathering resources, avoiding hostile alien creatures, and repairing your spaceship to escape the planet. The game would be a top-down exploration and survival game with a focus on resource management and combat.

    Features:
        Exploration: The player explores the alien planet, discovering new areas, gathering resources like minerals, food, and parts to repair the spaceship.
        Alien Creatures: Different types of alien creatures inhabit the planet. Some are hostile and will attack the player, while others might be neutral or even helpful. You could introduce varying levels of difficulty with different types of aliens.
        Resource Management: The player needs to manage their oxygen levels, health, and inventory space. Resources like oxygen tanks and health kits could be scattered around the planet or crafted from gathered materials.
        Spaceship Repair: The ultimate goal is to gather enough parts to repair the spaceship. Each part could be hidden in different areas of the map, guarded by tougher enemies or requiring specific tools to access.
        Day-Night Cycle: Introduce a day-night cycle where the planet becomes more dangerous at night, with more aggressive alien creatures emerging, forcing the player to find shelter.
        Puzzle Elements: Add simple puzzles that the player must solve to access certain areas or resources, such as activating ancient alien technology or decrypting alien codes.

    Why It’s Interesting:
        Rich Theme: The space and alien planet setting allows for creative world-building and unique visuals, even in a 2D format.
        Varied Gameplay: The combination of exploration, combat, resource management, and puzzles offers varied gameplay that can keep players engaged.
        Challenge: Balancing survival elements with the need to progress by repairing the spaceship provides a continuous challenge.

Basic Version (4-6 weeks)
Week 1-2:

Setup & Basic Mechanics: Set up the game environment, including player movement and basic map design. Implement simple alien creatures and basic collision detection.
Resource Management: Introduce basic resource management (e.g., oxygen levels, health).
Week 3-4:

Exploration & Combat: Develop the exploration aspect, with a few distinct areas to explore. Implement basic combat mechanics with simple alien AI.
Spaceship Repair Mechanics: Start working on the spaceship repair objectives, including gathering parts.
Week 5:

Day-Night Cycle & Advanced Mechanics: Add the day-night cycle and any additional features like more advanced alien AI or puzzle elements.
UI & Feedback: Implement basic UI elements (inventory, health, oxygen levels) and provide feedback to the player (e.g., alerts when oxygen is low).
Week 6:

Polish & Testing: Refine the game by fixing bugs, balancing gameplay, and optimizing performance. Conduct playtesting to ensure the game is fun and challenging.

Ideas:

- hunger, thirst, oxygen, health

- hunger = cook alien (with fire at ship) + 50% hunger
- thirst = cook water (with fire at ship) or water bottle + 20% thirst
- oxygen = oxygen tank + 50% oxygen
- health = sleep (+10%/hour), health package (+25%) and eating(+20%)
